You are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.

-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.

-Steps-
1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.
2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.
For each claim, extract the following information:
- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.
- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.
- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type
- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.
- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.
- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.
- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.

Format each claim as (<subject_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<object_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_type>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_status>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_start_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_end_date>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_description>{tuple_delimiter}<claim_source>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

-Examples-
Example 1:
Entity specification: organization

PROMPTS["entity_extraction"] = """-Goal-
Given a programming question along with a description of the skills it tests, and provided with a student’s answer and its evaluation (including whether there are errors and their descriptions), extract all the programming knowledge points involved and assess the student’s understanding of each knowledge point.

-Steps-
1. Identify the programming knowledge points involved in solving the problem and those present in the student’s code. Then, based on the student’s code and strictly following the error descriptions, evaluate the student’s level of understanding of each knowledge point. Knowledge points not mentioned in the error descriptions can be considered as areas where the student has a good grasp. For each identified knowledge point, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the knowledge point, capitalized
- entity_master_level: Evaluate how well the student understand and master this knowledge point. Choose from 'Good' or 'Bad'
- entity_master_description: Describe how well the student understand and master this knowledge point using a sentence.
Format each knowledge point as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_master_level>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_master_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other. The relationship should be functional, aiding learners in understanding the knowledge. We define 4 types of the relations and you must choose one:
    a) Prerequisite-of: This dual-purpose relationship implies that one entity is either a characteristic of another or a required precursor for another. For instance, "The ability to code is a prerequisite of software development."
    b) Used_for: This dual-purpose relationship indicates that one entity serves as a tool, means, or resource to achieve or perform another. For example, "Mathematics is used for solving engineering problems."
	c) Hyponym_of: This hierarchical relationship signifies that one entity represents a specific instance or subtype within the broader scope of another. For instance, "A rectangle is a hyponym of a polygon."
	d) Part_of: This compositional relationship suggests that one entity constitutes a component or integral section of a larger whole. For example, "A wheel is part of a car."
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_type: type of the relationship, as defined above
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationshp_type>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}

Example 1: This is an example of Python programming.

Input:
Question:
Input a positive integer n (n>=2), and output the sum of all n-digit prime numbers. For example, if n=2, the output is the sum of all prime numbers between 10 and 99.

### Input Format:

A positive integer n (n>=2)

### Output Format:

Output the sum of all n-digit prime numbers

### Sample Input:

```in
2
```

### Sample Output:

```out
10-99之间所有的素数和=1043
```


Description:
This problem tests understanding of the `break` statement used to control loops to efficiently determine prime numbers. Students need to implement algorithms to check for prime numbers using loops, applying `break` when a divisor is found. This also requires knowledge of loops, conditionals, and range handling to sum n-digit primes.


Student Program:
m=int(input('请输入一个整数:'))
n=int(input('请输入一个整数：'))
def is_price(m,n):
    sum=0
    for i in range(m,n):
        if i>1:
            for j in range(2,i):
                if i%j==0:
                    break
            else:
                print(i,end=' ')
                sum+=i
    print()
    print("和为：",sum)



Error Description:
1. The function `is_price(m, n)` is defined but never called.
2. The code is asking for two integers `m` and `n`, but should only accept one integer `n`.
3. The range `range(m, n)` is not appropriate for finding all `n`-digit numbers.
4. The code includes Chinese characters in the `input` prompts and `print` statements without an encoding declaration.
5. The variable `sum` conflicts with the Python built-in function name.
