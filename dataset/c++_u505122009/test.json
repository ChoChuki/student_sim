        "error_desc": "1. The `conv` function incorrectly filters the input sequence by only appending characters greater than the previous one, which alters the original digit sequence.\n2. In the `simulate` function, subtracting characters directly results in incorrect numerical differences instead of digit differences.\n3. The initial string `s` is improperly constructed by combining `l.substr(0, l.size() - 1)` and `r`, deviating from the problem's sequence generation requirements.\n4. The program does not correctly implement the recurrence relation for calculating `x_{i,j}`, leading to incorrect final results.\n5. The output is printed as a string instead of an integer, causing format discrepancies."
